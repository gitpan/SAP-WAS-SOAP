      SAP::WAS::SOAP
===========================


This module set is designed for doing HTTP based SOAP encoded RFC calls to and SAP R/3 system via the SAP Web Application Server ( the WAS ) .

Look at the examples directory.  These are setup to run from the examples directory and do not require you to install the package.
It is setup for my test environment which uses the SAP WAS system ( Web Application Server ) - version 6.10.
You need to ensure that login to the /sap/bc/soap/rfc service has been configured correctly using SAP transaction SICF, first, or this will not work ( under the version 6.10 WAS that I used the only thing I had to change was the settings for the auto login user ) - this corresponds directly to the URL that is supplied to the SAP::WAS::SOAP constructor.

For help - I can be contacted at piers@ompa.net

Cheers.
